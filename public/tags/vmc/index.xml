      <description>Automate your VM Deployments In this Blogpost you will learn to leverage one of my favourite automation tools called &amp;ldquo;GoVC&amp;rdquo; to automate your virtual machine and OVF-Deployments for VMware Cloud on AWS and vSphere. The tool does a great job making in creating repeatable deployments of VMs and OVFs.
If you are working with lab environments it´s key to have a repeatable and reliable way to deploy your VMs without having to enter a lot data over and over again.</description>

      <description>Leveraging the Prometheus Operator on VMC Prometheus was the second project which joined the Cloud Native Computing foundation after Kubernetes in 2016. Originally it was founded 2012 at Soundcloud but is now completely vendor independent and open source. A lot companies have already adopted Prometheus, and the project has a highly active community. Customers which are running VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid+ are provided with full Enterprise support included with their TKG+ subscription.</description>

      <description>Tanzu Kubernetes Grid is GA! In this blogpost I am going to show you how easy it is to setup, configure and lifecycle enterprise K8s Clusters and applications on VMware Cloud.
We will deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid to VMConAWS as well as an application which uses Cloud Native vSAN Storage and existing services on VMConAWS to expose it to the outside world.
Before we start i would like to introduce you to the basic concepts of Tanzu Kubernetes Grid.</description>

      <description>In this blogpost we´re going to perform an exemplary application modernization. I wanted to provide an easy and understandable example how an existing application can be modernized in order to take advantages of modern application architecture by leveraging Kubernetes.
Modernising parts of an existing application is what I observed in real world customer scenarios. Parts of an application are modernized to take the maximum value compared to the high effort of refactoring the whole application.</description>
